# Methods

The length-weight relationship we use is the following:
\begin{equation}
W = \alpha L^{\beta}
\end{equation}
where $W$ is weight, $L$ is length, and $a$ and $b$ are the allometric parameters to be estimated.

Individual fish observations of length-weight pairs are used to estimate model parameters.

The units of length and weight will influence the parameter values, so in all analyses presented, lengths are in centimeters and weights are in grams.

## Hierarchical approach
A minimum number of samples must be available in order to meaningfully estimate $a$ and $b$ parameters. The available length information must also cover a wide range of lengths so that estimated parameter values can be used in predictions.

Hierarchical approach

1. overall relationship, sex-independent and time-independent
2. sex-dependent relationship
3. time-dependent relationship
4. sex- and time-dependent relationship


## Mixed effects models

To estimate sex and year effects on the length-weight relationship, a mixed effects framework is adopted to analyse the available individual observations of fish length-weight pairs. For species with no sex-specific observations, yearly effects are added to both parameters:

\begin{equation}
W =  \left(\alpha +\delta^{\alpha}_{y}\right)L^{\left(\beta +\delta^{\beta}_{y} \right)}
\end{equation}

For species with sex-specific observations, yearly and sex effects are added to both parameters:

\begin{equation}
W =  \left(\alpha +\delta^{\alpha}_{ys}\right)L^{\left(\beta +\delta^{\beta}_{ys} \right)}
\end{equation}


The model is implemented as a Generalized Mixed Effects Model with a Gamma error distribution and a log link:

\begin{equation}
\mu = exp(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}l + \epsilon)
\end{equation}


## Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence ecosystem survey

Observations of fish and invertebrate taxa collected during the annual southern Gulf of St. Lawrence September survey are used to obtain taxon-specific estimates of the length-weight relationship. 


The taxa used in the analyses appear in Table \@ref(tab:tabletaxa).
