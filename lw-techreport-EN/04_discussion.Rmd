# Discussion

The values of $a$ and $b$ parameters are used to flag erroneous lengths and weights measurements during data collection.

The predicted weights obtained from the fitted model are used in computations of biomass indices based on individual length observations. 

If the yearly changes in estimated values of $a$ and $b$ are auto-correlated, it may be indicative of gradual changes in condition. An alternative modelling approach that accounts for this auto-correlation should be investigated.

The availability of a sufficient number of samples is key to estimating a meaningful length-weight relationship.
