# Weight-at-size data sets

There are two groups of weight-at-size data. The first group stems from measurements taken on board the Septmeber multispecies survey, starting way back in 1970 for certain species. 
The second group of data are specific to snow crab. Major factors influencing snow crab weight are the morphometric maturity, the shell condition (i.e. new or old-shelled) and the pattern of missing legs.

## PEI study

Samples were gathered using a 20-meter Nephrops trawl and an experimental trap survey (6 by 6-foot rectangular traps) in the southwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence in July of 1986. The sample contains about 300 male crab of different maturities and molt categories. Crab sizes are mainly 90 mm carapace width and larger. Crab which lost legs during the sampling process were discarded.
