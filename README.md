# Background
Weight-at-size equations are very common in animal observational studies. 

As their name implies, they serve to predict an animal's weight, which is generally harder to measure, to some convenient size measurement. 

These equations can be used to convert size-frequencies of a given population to equivalent weights.

They can also be used to characterize different species or populations, or as controls to evaluate animal condition, since the weight of an animal also reflects some aspects of its health.

The form of the euqation is the allometric relation $w = ax^b$.
